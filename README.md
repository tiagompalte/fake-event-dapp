# Fake Event DApp

This is a decentralized application (DApp) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) that simulates event creation and participation on the blockchain. The project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

- Create and manage fake events
- Simulate blockchain interactions
- Modern UI with [Geist](https://vercel.com/font)
- Fast development with Next.js App Router

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You can start editing the app by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
